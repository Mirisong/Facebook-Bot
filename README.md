# Facebook Bot

Automates deleting posts from Sold and Archived feeds of Facebook groups.

To use, log in, go to the appropriate feed and click the add-on's button.
It will automatically extract all the visible posts and start deleting them.
Scrolling down a long way into the feed will let it extract more at once.
